3. **Screen Sizes**: Test on desktop, tablet (768px), and mobile (375px)
4. **Theme**: Test both light and dark modes

### Testing URLs
- **Community**: `http://localhost:3000/community`
- **Notifications**: `http://localhost:3000/notifications`
- **Main App**: `http://localhost:3000`

## üîç Critical Test Areas

### High Priority (Must Pass)
1. **Page Loading**: All pages load without errors
2. **Navigation**: Tab switching and page navigation work
3. **Core Interactions**: Buttons, toggles, and input fields function
4. **Mobile Layout**: Responsive design works on all screen sizes
5. **Dark Mode**: Theme switching maintains usability

### Medium Priority (Should Pass)
1. **Search Functionality**: Search bars accept input and show feedback
2. **Visual Design**: Consistent styling and proper contrast
3. **Performance**: Pages load within 3 seconds
4. **Error Handling**: No JavaScript errors in console

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced Interactions**: Complex gesture support

3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility
4. **Edge Cases**: Unusual input handling

## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### Community Platform
- **Missing Images**: Placeholder images may not load
- **Empty States**: Learning Paths and Study Groups show "Coming Soon"
- **Interactive Elements**: Like/comment buttons may not have backend functionality
- **Data Consistency**: Mock data should be realistic but static

### Notifications System
- **Mock Notifications**: Notifications are pre-generated, not real-time
- **Search Results**: Search may not return actual results yet
- **Settings Persistence**: Settings changes might not persist across sessions
- **Action Buttons**: Notification actions may not navigate to actual features

## üìù Test Documentation

### Recording Results
- Mark each test as **PASS/FAIL**
- Note any issues or unexpected behavior
- Include screenshots for visual issues
- Record load times and performance metrics

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: Prevents basic functionality
- **Major**: Significantly impacts user experience
- **Minor**: Small visual or usability issues
- **Enhancement**: Suggestions for improvement

## üîÑ Retest Process

### If Tests Fail
1. **Document the Issue**: Record specific failure details
2. **Categorize Severity**: Critical, Major, Minor, or Enhancement
3. **Report to Developer**: Provide clear reproduction steps
4. **Retest After Fix**: Verify the specific issue is resolved
5. **Regression Test**: Ensure fix didn't break other functionality

### Success Criteria for Sign-off
- **Community Platform**: ‚â•90% of tests pass (‚â•20/22 tests)
- **Notifications System**: ‚â•90% of tests pass (‚â•25/28 tests)
- **Critical Issues**: 0 critical issues remaining
- **Performance**: Page loads within 3 seconds
