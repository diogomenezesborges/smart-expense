   - Data normalization and cleansing

2. **Intelligent Categorization**
   - ML algorithm analyzes transaction data:
     - Merchant name/description
     - Amount patterns
     - Date/time context
     - Historical user corrections
   - Confidence scoring for each categorization
   - Queue low-confidence items for manual review

3. **User Notification**
   - Daily summary of new transactions
   - Alert for items requiring manual review
   - WhatsApp/email notification options

   - Navigate to "Pending Reviews" section
   - View list of uncategorized/low-confidence transactions

2. **Transaction Review Process**
   - For each transaction, see:
     - Transaction details (date, amount, merchant)
     - System's suggested category + confidence score
     - Similar historical transactions for context
   - User actions:
     - Approve suggestion
     - Select different category
     - Create new category
     - Add notes/tags

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Select multiple similar transactions
   - Apply category to all selected
   - Create rules for future similar transactions

4. **Learning Feedback Loop**
   - System updates ML model with user corrections
   - Improved categorization for similar future transactions
   - User sees accuracy improvements over time

**Success Criteria:** User can efficiently review and categorize 20+ transactions in under 5 minutes
